- Replace with neutral MCP tool call format (Tool/Parameters/Returns)
- Add comprehensive tag-based workflow discovery examples
- Create example workflow YAML files (simple-ci, conditional-deploy, parallel-testing)
- Add grep search patterns for navigating large reference files
- Enhance "When to Activate" with natural language triggers
- Remove dist/ build artifacts (source-based distribution only)
